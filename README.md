## 🔒 Cybersecurity Projects

### **SOC Simulation Lab** *(In Progress)*

- Deployed a virtual Security Operations Center using Splunk Free and Security Onion to simulate real-world threat detection
- Developed and fine-tuned custom correlation rules to trigger alerts on unauthorized access attempts and abnormal login behavior

> **What I learned:**  
> I learned how to deploy and manage a virtual SOC using Splunk and Security Onion to monitor network traffic and detect threats. I also gained experience creating custom correlation rules to identify suspicious activities like unauthorized access and unusual login patterns.

### **Password Cracking and Hash Analysis** *(Jan 2025)*

- Scripted brute-force and dictionary attacks using Python to identify vulnerabilities in MD5 and SHA-1 hash algorithms
- Benchmarked modern hashing techniques (e.g., SHA-256, bcrypt) to assess computational resistance to cracking

> **What I learned:**  
> I learned how to use Python to perform brute-force and dictionary attacks on weak hashes like MD5 and SHA-1. I also gained insight into why stronger hashing methods like SHA-256 and bcrypt are more resistant to cracking.

### **Home Lab Network Hardening** *(Sept 2024)*

- Architected a segmented home network using pfSense, VLANs, and dynamic firewall rules to isolate and protect devices
- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nmap and remediated open ports and misconfigurations
- Implemented syslog servers and intrusion detection features to monitor network traffic and anomalies

> **What I learned:**  
> I learned how to build a secure, segmented home network using pfSense, VLANs, and dynamic firewall rules. I also gained hands-on experience finding and fixing vulnerabilities and setting up monitoring to detect suspicious activity.
